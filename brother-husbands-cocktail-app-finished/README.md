# Cocktail Database

## Description
Have you ever grown sick of the same tired cocktails you always turn to, but never enjoy  making up your own? The following database provides a wide number of cocktail recipes that can be searched by a specific cocktail name, or even an ingredient you wished to include. You will be prompted to select one result to display at a time. Once generated you will be given the suggested glass for use, and measurements for each ingredient. There will also be a table offering nutrition facts of each cocktail.

## Usage
The following are two pictures of what the website should look like when opened in a browser.
